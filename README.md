# FREEFLOW

	Welcome to FreeFlow. This application is still in production, but we are happy  
	to have anyone on board to assist us. Our goal is to have the site live by the  
	end of this year with minimal functionality to begin with.

	FreeFlow is a Social Media Network which connects users based on their skills  
	and assets to others that have specific wants and needs. Users can surf the  
  dashboard or userlist to find others that need or want something that they  
	can offer. When a user helps another out, they gain points. As they gain  
	more points they will become more eligible to be helped by others.

	There is a gaming aspect involved in this app, as the points will become  
	a ranking system which gives users more privileges to make bigger asks.  
	There will be an achievements feature implemented in the near future which  
	gives users more points, as well as skill levels for any skills a user may have  
	(which can be just about anything). The intention is to make the app fun for  
	users to interact with each other and perpetuate their desire to help others  
	and gain ranks, skill levels and achievements.

	If you have anymore questions, or would like to know more about the app's  
	functionality you can email the founder at mathiusjohnsondeveloper@gmail.com.
